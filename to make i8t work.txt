to make it work or turn on paste:

cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\ai-crypto-dashboard\backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\ai-crypto-dashboard\backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload


after doing this to use the website do:

1. Make sure backend is running
In Command Prompt:

text
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\ai-crypto-dashboard\backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
Leave that window open.

Then open dashboard.html in your browser.

2. Choose the crypto and timeframe
On the website:

In the Symbol box (top left of the controls), type the Binance pair, for example:

BTCUSDT

ETHUSDT

SOLUSDT

In Interval, choose:

1m → super short‑term scalping

5m / 15m → intraday

1h / 4h → swing

Click Sync AI with chart.

This calls:

text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/crypto/<SYMBOL>?interval=<INTERVAL>
and gets the last candles + RSI + EMA + BUY/SELL/HOLD array.

3. Read the AI signal
On the right AI panel:

Big badge:

If it shows BUY in green → AI thinks conditions are good to buy (RSI < 30 and price above EMA).

If it shows SELL in red → AI thinks conditions are overbought (RSI > 70).

If it shows HOLD in grey → no strong signal.

Under that:

Symbol → which pair the signal is for (e.g. BTCUSDT).

Interval → timeframe used (must match what you chose).

Last updated → time of the latest candle used to generate the signal.

Below that:

Recent signals → list of the last ~20 signals with timestamps, so you can see if it’s flipping a lot or staying in one direction.

4. Keep it updating
By default, Auto‑refresh: ON (30s). That means every 30 seconds it:

Hits your backend again.

Updates the BUY/SELL/HOLD and the history list.

You can click the Auto‑refresh button to turn it OFF if you just want manual updates.

So the basic flow:

Start backend.

Open dashboard.html.

Type symbol (e.g. BTCUSDT), pick interval (e.g. 1h).

Hit Sync AI with chart.

Watch the AI badge and recent signals to see current BUY/SELL/HOLD for that setup.
